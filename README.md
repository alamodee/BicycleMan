# Bike Man

This is my term project of 15112 - Fundamentals of Programming -  Fall 2017 at Carnegie Mellon University.


## Description

Bike Man is a simple side scrolling game using Tkinter, in which the aim is to keep cycling as long as possible.  
The map is computer generated, so youâ€™ll never see the same map pattern twice. You can choose "difficulty" and "number of players" from setting window.  
There is also an item feature. Once you get 3 fans, you'll get a boost, which allows you to gain more distance in a shorter amount of time.  
For single player mode -  press "Up" to jump.  
For multiplayer mode -  player1 (upper screen) :  press "E" to jump /  player2 (lower screen) : press "Up" to jump.
